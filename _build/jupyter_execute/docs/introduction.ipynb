    "Research shows that in the Netherlands crime rates have been slowly descending ever since the millennium change, but that it still fluctuates throughout the year. This project investigates if crime rates are in any way influenced by weather conditions. By analyzing databases from the KNMI (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute) and the CBS (Statistics Netherlands) we hope to find out if there are any correlations between the two phenomena. These are created by government organisations. Finding a correlation could possibly help first responders stay informed on the matters of crime, and raise general societal awareness on the influences on crime."

    "This perspective argues that warm, sunny, and dry conditions may lead to an increase in specific types of criminal activity, namely property and substance related. The underlying idea is that people spend more time outdoors in good weather, which creates more opportunities for certain crimes to occur.to occur.\n",

    "Argument 2.1: Increased rainfall has no correlation to the amount of burglaries \\\n",
    "Many people assume that rainy weather might deter burglars by reducing opportunities for crime. However, studies suggest that increased rainfall does not necessarily correlate with a decrease in burglary incidents (Peng et al., 2011). This raises questions about how weather factors truly influence property crime rates. \\\n",

    "Argument 2.2: Serious crimes are not seasonally dependent \\\n",
    "Crimes such as abuse, murder, and cybercrime do not show significant seasonal or weather-based variation. This argument is based on the idea that these crimes are driven more by social or personal factors than environmental conditions.\n",
