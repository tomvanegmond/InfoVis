    "## Datasets\n",
    "For this research we wanted to find the correlation between crime and weather. Luckily these two categories are well documented, and the data was easy to find. We make use of two reliable government sources. \n",
    "The first is the KNMI file with daily weather observations from station Schiphol (STN 240). It is downloaded from: https://www.knmi.nl/nederland-nu/klimatologie/daggegevens. This dataset contains all measurements from January 1, 2012, through April 30, 2025: in total 4,873 day‑rows and 48 columns. The dataset contains all standard weather measurements from KNMI. There are too many to go over, so here are the variables we used in our analysis. We give the name used in the dataset, followed by its meaning and the way we will refer to it from now on:\n",
    "- `TX` - `Maximum temperature` (in 0.1 °C)  \n",
    "- `SQ`- `Sunshine duration` (in hours)\n",
    "- `VVN` - `Minimum visibility` (in 100 meters) \n",
    "- `TG` - `Average temperature` (in 0.1 °C)  \n",
    "- `DR` -`Precipitation` (in # of hours)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second source is the CBS table ‘Registered crimes; type of crime, district, neighborhood; monthly figures’. This dataset is downloaded from: https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/83648NED/table?fromstatweb. This contains monthly counts for sixty crime categories. We used the version that was available on June 10, 2025. This covers the period from January 2012 through April 2025. The variables we used are:\n",
    "- `1.2.3 Diefstal van brom-, snor-, fietsen` – `Bicycle theft`  \n",
    "- `3.4.2 Onder invloed (water)` – `Under influence (water)`  \n",
    "- `1.1.1 Diefstal/inbraak woning` – `Burglary/theft from home`  \n",
    "- `1.3.1 Ongevallen (weg)` – `Traffic accidents`  \n",
    "- `2.5.2 Winkeldiefstal` – `Shoplifting`  \n",
    "- `1.2.4 Zakkenrollerij` – `Pickpocketing`  \n",
    "- `1.4.2 Moord, doodslag` – `Murder, manslaughter`  \n",
    "- `1.4.5 Mishandeling` – `Abuse`  \n",
    "- `3.7.4 Cybercrime` – `Cybercrime`  \n",
    "- `1.4.3 Openlijk geweld (persoon)` – `Public violence`\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the data consists of only continuous numeric values, we can explore linear relationships between weather variables and crime categories through Pearson's correlation, as well as use scatterplots and regression models to visualize patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cleaning\n",
    "Although the datasets were already delivered very well by the institutions, it was still necessary to make some small adjustments for further processing and merging. While cleaning the data, all column names were first stripped of unnecessary spaces so that all variables would be recognized correctly. Then, in the KNMI file, all data columns were converted to numeric values. This prevents issues caused by missing measurements sometimes being stored as empty text fields, which can cause problems when calculating averages. In the CBS file, the dot (.) that indicates a suppressed observation was also replaced by the mean numeric value for that column.\n",
    "The KNMI and CBS datasets were not structured in the same way. One had the recorded time as rows and the other as columns. Because of this, we first had to adjust the CBS dataset to have the date as the first column instead of as row, to be able to merge them by date. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Aggregation\n",
    "Since the CBS dataset gives monthly values per crime category and the KNMI provides daily measurements, we decided to take a monthly average for each weather variable. These averages give a general idea of a particular weather variable during that month. We did this by simply taking the mean of each separate month for the weather data. This was possible because of the date codes in the dataset. This resulted in a dataset containing monthly average weather variables.\n",
    "After the two datasets were prepared, we could merge them. Only months that are present in both sources were retained. We were able to merge the two datasets using the date, which we formatted identically in both datasets. The end result consists of 160 rows and 102 columns, one key column (the date), 41 weather features, and 60 crime categories.\n"
